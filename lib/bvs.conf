# For more information:
# TOPIC        FILE                              DOXYGEN (see Readme.txt)
# syntax       'lib/include/bvs/config.h'        'Classes->BVS::Config'
# bvs options  'lib/include/bvs/bvs.h'           'Classes->BVS::BVS'
# bvs defaults 'lib/include/bvs/traits.h'        'Files->include/bvs/traits.h'

# Settings for the BVS framework (defaults: <...>).
# These should go into section:
# [BVS]

# connectorTypeMatching = <ON> | OFF
# Warn about connector type mismatch (uses RTTI).

# logSystem = <ON> | OFF
# Enable logging system.

# logConsole = <ON> | OFF
# Log to console.

# logFile = <> | BVSLog.txt | ...
# Log to file (empty disables, +FILE appends to file).

# logVerbosity = 0 | 1 | 2 | <3> | ...
# Overall system log verbosity.

# logStatistics = ON | <OFF>
# Displays module statistics after each round.

# moduleThreads = <ON> | OFF
# Allow modules to run in dedicated threads.

# forceModuleThreads = ON | <OFF>
# Force modules to run in dedicated threads.
# NOTE: this does NOT disable module pools.

# modulePools = <ON> | OFF
# Allow modules to be bundled in pools.

# modules = ''
# List of modules to load.
#
# Full specification of a module line ('[...]' are optional arguments):
#
# modules [+]= [+|poolName]id[(library[.configuration])][.connectorOptions]
#
# [+] -> Append to the module list.
# [+|poolName] -> Load module inside its own pool ('+') or add/create to a
#             module pool of name 'poolName' which also runs inside its own
#             thread and executes added modules in the given order.
#             '+' is effectively a shorthand for '[id]id'.
#             NOTE: 'poolName' MUST be inside '[...]', '+' MUST not.
# [(library...)] -> Use as module library, useful for multiple modules from one
#                   library.
# [.configuration] -> Use this configuration for the module, useful so the
#                     module name does not change but its configuration does.
# [.connectorOptions] -> Options for connectors, looks as follows:
#                        input(test.output)[.input2(test.output2)]...
#
# If configuration and/or library are not given, the system will use the given
# id instead (useful as a shorthand).
#
# EXAMPLES:
# <shorthand>                     <verbose>
# id                              id(id.id)
# id(lib)                         id(lib.id)
# +id2(lib2)                      [id2]id2(lib2.id2)
# +id3(lib2.config).in(id2.out)   [id3]id3(lib2.config).in(id2.out)
# [pool]id4.in(id3.out)           [pool]id4(id4.id4).in(id3.out)
